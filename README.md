This repository contains a demonstration of an uncommon bug in a recursive JavaScript function. The function `foo` aims to compare two numbers, `a` and `b`.  It recursively increments `a` until it reaches or exceeds `b`. The bug lies in the base case which mishandles the equality condition leading to unexpected results in some cases. The solution demonstrates how to fix the code by resolving this base case issue.
